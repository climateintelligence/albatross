Albatross (the bird)
  *Albatross is a bird designed for seasonal forecasting of hydroclimatic variables.*

This WPS is designed to produce deterministic forecasts of seasonal hydroclimatic variables (e.g. precipitation, temperature, streamflows,...) of a given location, leveraging teleconnections. It is built upon the Ni√±o Index Phase Analysis (NIPA) framework by Zimmerman et al. (2016).


üîç What NIPA Does
-----------------

NIPA classifies historical climate data (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature, SST) according to the phases of El Ni√±o, typically using the Oceanic Ni√±o Index (ONI). For each phase (e.g., El Ni√±o, La Ni√±a, Neutral), NIPA:

- Identifies relevant spatial patterns in SST fields via linear correlation masks
- Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality
- Calibrates a linear regression model on the first principal component to predict hydroclimatic outcomes

‚ú® What‚Äôs New in Albatross
--------------------------

Albatross extends the original NIPA framework with several innovations:

- üåç New Teleconnection Indices: In addition to ONI, Albatross incorporates other teleconnections like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to enhance predictive skill across different regions.
- üìâ Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction: The number of PCA components retained is dynamically chosen based on the explained variance, improving robustness and interpretability.
- üß† Modular Architecture: Albatross is built to easily accommodate new climate indices, regions, and variables.

üî≠ What‚Äôs Next
--------------

We‚Äôre actively working on expanding Albatross with more powerful and flexible tools:

- ‚ûï More Indices: Planned integration of additional teleconnections (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation) to cover broader climatic regimes.
- üîÅ Nonlinear Relationships: Introduction of Mutual Information and other nonlinear dependency measures to detect subtler teleconnection patterns.
- ü§ñ Machine Learning Models: Future versions will explore nonlinear models, including Random Forests, and other ML tools to improve forecast accuracy and capture complex dependencies.

üîß Requirements to Run Albatross
--------------------------------

To use the Albatross WPS for forecasting, you need to provide:

**üìÑ Input File**

- A plain-text file containing monthly hydroclimatic data (e.g., precipitation, temperature, etc.) for a single location.
- The file must follow the Albatross format, structured as:
- The first line must contain the title (e.g., E-OBS_precipitation)
- The second line must include two numbers: the starting year and ending year
- The following lines must contain monthly values in row-wise format, ordered by year (12 values per year)

‚úÖ Example file: https://github.com/climateintelligence/albatross/blob/main/albatross/data/E-OBS_precipitation_Como.txt
(You can browse from your computer or provide a direct URL, such as a raw GitHub link)


**üßæ Additional Parameters**

You must also specify the following inputs when running the WPS:

+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter            | Description                                                                      |
+======================+==================================================================================+
| Start year           | First year of the time series (e.g., 1950)                                       |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| End year             | Last year of the time series (e.g., 2023)                                        |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Target Season        | Numeric code for the target season: 1 = JFM, ..., 12 = DJF                       |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Phase mode (int)     | Whether to apply NIPA separately for El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a phases (1 or 2)         |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
